# Mobile PriceRange Prediction(Classification) - Machine learning Project
This repository houses the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting mobile phone price ranges. In the fast-paced mobile industry, understanding key factors that influence pricing is essential for market analysis and smart decision-making. 

## Project Summary 
This project aims to predict the price range of mobile phones (Low, Medium, High, Very High) using machine learning. The dataset includes 21 features like battery power, camera quality, screen size, and RAM.

## Project Workflow:
* Data Wrangling – Handle missing values and correct inconsistencies (e.g., replacing zero values in resolution & screen width).                                    
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Uncover patterns, correlations, and key factors affecting price, such as battery capacity and RAM.                          
* Hypothesis Testing – Validate assumptions and detect outliers to ensure accurate modeling.                         
* Feature Engineering – Create & refine features for better predictions.                             
* Machine Learning Models – Compare algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, tuning them for optimal performance.    

## Conclusion    
This machine learning project provides insights into the factors influencing the price range of mobile phones. By leveraging the dataset's features, we successfully built a predictive model capable of accurately classifying mobile phone price ranges. The project highlights the significance of variables such as RAM, battery power, and pixel quality in determining the price range.
